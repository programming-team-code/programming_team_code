## Tips and Tricks

File IO
```
freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
```

If you changed something for debugging, add a `cout << "don't submit" << endl;`
or `assert(0);` at the end of the code

for policy base DS:
```
#include <bits/extc++.h>
```

don't use cin for doubles/floats, it's slow, read into string, then convert to double/float

- invokes RTE (Run Time Error) upon integer overflow
```
#pragma GCC optimize "trapv"
```
- invoke RTE for input error (e.g. reading a int64_t into an int)
```
cin.exceptions(cin.failbit);
```

- use pramgas for C++ speed boost
```
#pragma GCC optimize("O3,unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("avx2,bmi,bmi2,lzcnt,popcnt")
```

- mark functions as `inline` for C++ speed boost

### Troubleshooting
```
// - stuff you should look for
// - int overflow, array bounds
// - special cases (n=1?)
// - do smth instead of nothing and stay organized
// - WRITE STUFF DOWN
// - DON'T GET STUCK ON ONE APPROACH
```
